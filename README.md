# C-projects
This repository contains all my C++ projects that I have built so far

## HUffman Encoding: 
This is a data compression and decompression program that uses the Huffman Encoding and Decoding approach. It can compress
and decompress multiple files at once with an efficiency of upto 40%. 

## TSP-1
"Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route 
that visits each city and returns to the origin city?". The following is a Traveling Salesman Program, which 
is proven to be an NP complete program. This program tries to solve the Traveling Salesman Program using a 
Randomized Search approach. 

## TSP-2
It tries to solve the Travelling Salesman Program using a Genetic Algorithms Approach. "Genetic Algorithms (GA) 
is a family of heuristics (approximation algorithms) that draw inspiration from natural evolution. In GA, we 
represent candidate solutions to a problem as “chromosomes”, and then mutate and “recombine” chromosomes to 
obtain new solutions and evaluate their “fitness” (how well they solve the problem). Because fitter solutions 
have a higher probability of getting selected for recombination and reproduction, the population of chromosomes 
slowly converges toward solutions with higher fitness. Let’s make this concrete with an example.". The results 
are better than the Randomized Search approach

## TSP-3
Experimented with different genetic operators and compared its effects to the baseline GA implementation in previous
part (TSP-2)

## TSP-4
Parallelizing the genetic algorithm using multithreading. It gives the most efficient approach towards solving the
Travelling Salesman Problem and almost finds a perfect answer towards solving the TSP problem

## Lets-Network
This is a zip file as the original folder was too big to upload. This zip file contains client and server files written in C. The server side is written using the crow library and the client side is written using the cpr library. More info on this over here [Let's Network Project](https://github.com/prg007/Lets_Network) 

## Multithreading in C++
Demonstrates the use of multithreading in C++. Using multithreading we saw remarkable improvements in the throughput and the latency of the requests we sent from the client to the server. More details over here
